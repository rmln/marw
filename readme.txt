About srmorph project

This is a set of scripts I use to experiment with Serbian
morphology.

The most important part is located in grammar module, and the
rest is compiled from there.

Corpus creation scripts are located in tools folder. See also
data/readme.txt.

Set the correct path of PATH in conf.py.

To see all the code in action, go to:

http://srmorph.languagebits.com

This is where web interface is located (not distributed
with this code).

To see available commands from line inteface, type:
$ python3 srmorph.py -h

In case you create your own corpus, don't forget to edit
readme template in conf.py.

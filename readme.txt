About srmorph project

This is a set sof scripts I use to experiment with Serbian
morphology.

The most important part is located in grammar module, and the
rest is compiled from there.

Corpus creation scripts are located in tools folder. See also
data/readme.txt.

To see all the code in action, go to:

http://srmorph.languagebits.com

This is where web interface is located (not distributed
with this code).
